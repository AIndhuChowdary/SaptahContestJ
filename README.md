# Today's Topic: Functions

### Functions

Functions "Encapsulate" a task (they combine many instructions into a single line of code). Most programming languages provide many built in functions that would otherwise require many steps to accomplish, for example computing the square root of a number. In general, we don't care how a function does what it does, only that it "does it"!  

When a function is "called" the program "leaves" the current section of code and begins to execute the first line inside the function. Thus the function "flow of control" is:  

1) The program comes to a line of code containing a "function call".  
2) The program enters the function (starts at the first line in the function code).  
3) All instructions inside of the function are executed from top to bottom.  
4) The program leaves the function and goes back to where it started from.  
5) Any data computed and RETURNED by the function is used in place of the function in the original line of code.

### Steps to Writing a Function

* Understand the purpose of the function.
* Define the data that comes into the function from the caller (in the form of parameters)!
* Define what data variables are needed inside the function to accomplish its goal.
* Decide on the set of steps that the program will use to accomplish this goal. (The Algorithm)
