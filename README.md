# Today's Topic: Arrays

### Applications of Arrays

* Arrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables.  
* Many databases, small and large, consist of one-dimensional arrays whose elements are records.  
* Arrays are used to implement other data structures, such as lists, heaps, hash tables, deques, queues and stacks.  
* One or more large arrays are sometimes used to emulate in-program dynamic memory allocation, particularly memory pool allocation. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate "dynamic memory" portably.  
* Arrays can be used to determine partial or complete control flow in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive) multiple “if” statements. They are known in this context as control tables and are used in conjunction with a purpose built interpreter whose control flow is altered according to values contained in the array. The array may contain subroutine pointers(or relative subroutine numbers that can be acted upon by SWITCH statements) that direct the path of the execution.
