# Problem Statement:
Write a program to find GCD of two numbers and also LCM of two numbers, But Given the user a choice, show how you would implement it using functions.   
  
1 - GCD  
2 - LCM  

Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. The first line of the input will be a single integer T, the number of test cases   
(1 ≤ T ≤ 100). Followed by the test cases, each test case is described in two lines one for the choice of input(GCD or LCM) and second line  
in which contains 2 integers separated by a single space X Y (1 ≤ X,Y ≤ 100). X and Y are the 2 numbers which you should print the GCD or LCM of them.  
  
You need not display the menu or prompt the user for choice, Implement input and output without any text being displayed. As shown in the example.  

# Example:
## Input: 
			4
			1
			12 24
			2
			3 5
			1
			3 16
			2
			9 7
			
## Output:
			12
			15
			1
			63
